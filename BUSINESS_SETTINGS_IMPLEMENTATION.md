# Business Settings Implementation

## Overview
We've implemented a comprehensive business settings system with the following features:

### 1. Business Settings Page (`src/pages/BusinessSettings.jsx`)
- **Profile Settings**: Business name, bio, contact info, location, website, address
- **Business Hours**: Set hours for each day of the week with open/closed status
- **Booking Settings**: Time slot duration, advance booking limits, cancellation policies
- **Notification Settings**: Email/SMS preferences for various booking events
- **Payment Settings**: Currency, tax rates, service fees, refund policies
- **Security Settings**: Placeholder for future security features

### 2. Database Tables (`business-settings-tables.sql`)
- `business_hours`: Stores business operating hours
- `business_booking_settings`: Stores booking preferences
- `business_notification_settings`: Stores notification preferences  
- `business_payment_settings`: Stores payment preferences

### 3. Business Hours Display (`src/components/BusinessHours.jsx`)
- Shows current open/closed status
- Displays hours for each day
- Highlights current day
- Real-time status updates

### 4. Time Slot Generator (`src/components/TimeSlotGenerator.jsx`)
- Generates available time slots based on business hours
- Respects booking settings (slot duration, max bookings per slot)
- Shows availability status
- Integrates with existing bookings

### 5. Enhanced Booking Modal Integration
- Replaced static time selection with dynamic TimeSlotGenerator
- Uses business hours and settings for accurate slot generation
