### **Step 1: Run Simple Admin Setup**
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**

## ðŸ§ª **Testing Your Setup**

After running the script, test with these queries in Supabase:

```sql
-- Test if you're an admin (after signing in)
SELECT is_admin() as is_admin;

-- Check your admin account
SELECT * FROM admin_users WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'henry@donco.coza');
```
